**Hi, I’m Mohammad Abdullah**

I’m a Computer Science student
specializing in Software Engineering with 
a minor in Business, passionate about 
building practical software, 
exploring AI-powered systems, 
and strengthening my foundations for a future in Cybersecurity.
I enjoy working on projects 
that blend real-world problem solving, 
automation, and clean system 
design—especially when they 
involve APIs, data, or AI-driven workflows.
